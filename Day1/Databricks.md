Day 1/14: 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝘆 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗸𝘀 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗝𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘆
Today wasn't about rushing through tutorials. It was about understanding why Databricks exists in the first place.

When you've worked with Pandas and heard about Hadoop, it's easy to ask: "Why do we need another tool?"
Day 1 answered that question.

What I learned:
Databricks isn't trying to replace Pandas. It's solving a different problem entirely, handling data at scale while bridging the gap between data lakes and data warehouses through Lakehouse architecture.

I also explored how companies like Netflix, Shell, and Comcast are using Databricks in production. Seeing real-world use cases made the "why" click.

What I built:
 ✅ Set up my Databricks Free Edition workspace
 ✅ Navigated Workspace, Compute, and Data Explorer
 ✅ Created my first notebook
 ✅ Imported an e-commerce dataset
 ✅ Ran initial PySpark commands to explore the data

Nothing groundbreaking. Just foundational work.

But that's the point. Day 1 is about building the right mental model before diving into execution.

Day 2 starts tomorrow , and that's where things get hands-on.

If you're learning Databricks or exploring data engineering, I'd love to connect. Drop a comment or follow along with the journey.
